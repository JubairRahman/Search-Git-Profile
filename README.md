## Tech Stack

This project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It uses the [Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) library to make HTTP requests to the GitHub API.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/JubairRahman/Search-Git-Profile.git`
2. Open `index.html` in your browser.

## Usage

Simply type a GitHub username into the search bar and hit Enter. The user's profile, along with their repositories and gists, will be displayed below.

## Code Overview

The JavaScript code in `script.js` handles the logic of the application. It makes asynchronous requests to the GitHub API to fetch user profiles, repositories, and gists. When a user is searched, it creates a user card with their profile details. If an error occurs, such as when a profile doesn't exist, it creates an error card displaying the error message.
